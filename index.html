        <h1>Welcome Friends!</h1>
        <h2>Get to know me!</h2>
        <p>I'm a 28 year old model from Opelousas, Louisiana. While attending the University of Louisiana at Lafayette my freshman year, I was scouted in a photography course by my professor who also doubled as a talent agent. I've traveled the to the most beautiful countries, and worked with numerous fashion brands. I'm also a creative. I love creating/directing my own projects. In 2020, I had the oppurtunity to direct my own Nike Jordan 23 shoot for the long anticipated Christmas release of the "JORDAN JUBILEE" sneaker. I'm really excited to make this transistion into a new career in tech. Being a developer will give the challenge me to not only think critically but creatively, which I love.</p>
